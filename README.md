## Introduction

1.   	What are the positive and negative aspects of lockdown and recovery measures on meeting Paris and net zero targets? 
 
2.   	Using multivariate signals to highlight these impacts and their inter-relationships to inform decision making. 

We are interested in approaches that evaluate how multivariate signals and their interrelationships can be used to highlight the path to recovery. The pandemic is essentially a large unplanned experiment, allowing us to consider the ex-ante/mid-post/ex-post aspects of the effectiveness of the lockdown measures. It further allows us to study the positive and negative aspects of lockdown behaviours and to differentiate between the two. It can also help us to better understand the challenges associated with reaching the 8% target of the Paris Accord and reaching net zero (lockdown restrictions have currently delivered both a 5% reduction in emissions, and a 14% reduction in GDP). Solutions addressing this theme can draw from a variety of data sources including EO, social media and other potential sources. 

During lockdown: less travel, decrease in cars + public transport (google mobility data?) 
Coming out of lockdown: increase in cars, not much increase in public transport
Need to optimise the number of people to fit on a bus/train whilst still following social distancing rules and motivate passengers to join
